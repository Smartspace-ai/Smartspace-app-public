# SmartSpace Chat UI

> **Template Repository:**
> 
> This repository is intended as a starting point for clients who want to build their own customized chat UI for Smartspace.

## üöÄ Automatic Deployment to Azure Static Web Apps

You can set up automatic deployment of your customized project to an Azure Storage Account configured as a static website using GitHub Actions. This requires the following configuration:

### 1. Create a GitHub Environment

- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Navigate to **Settings** > **Environments**.
- Click **New environment** and name it `smartspace`.

### 2. Add the Azure Storage Connection String Secret

- In your new `smartspace` environment.
- Click **Add environment secret**.
- Name the secret `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`.
- Paste your Azure Storage Account connection string as the value.

### 3. How It Works

When you push to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions will use the `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` secret to deploy the built application to your Azure Storage Account configured for static website hosting.

> **Note:** Ensure your Azure Storage Account is set up for static website hosting. For more information, see the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website).

## üé® Theming

The application uses CSS variables for theming, allowing easy customization of colors and styles. The primary color is defined in the `theme.scss` file, located in the `styles` directory.

### Changing the Primary Color

To update the primary color of the application:

1. **Open the `theme.scss` file in the `styles` directory.**
2. **Locate the `$primary-hex` variable:**

   ```scss
   // Primary input color
   $primary-hex: #FF5B37;
   ```

3. **Replace the `#6443f4` value with your desired hex color code.**
4. **Save the file.** The application's primary color will now reflect the new value.

> **Note:** The `theme.scss` file uses HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values derived from the `$primary-hex` to define various color variables. Ensure that the new primary color provides sufficient contrast and accessibility.

For more detailed information on theming with shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, refer to the [shadcn UI Theming Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming).

## üñºÔ∏è Updating the Logo

The logo component is located at `components/Logo.tsx`. To update the logo:

1. **Open the `Logo.tsx` file in the `components` directory.**
2. **Modify the `Logo` component to return your desired logo.** For example, to use an image file:

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';
   import logo from '../assets/logo.png'; // Adjust the path as necessary

   interface LogoProps {
     className?: string;
   }

   export const Logo: React.FC<LogoProps> = ({ className }) => {
     return <img src={logo} alt="SmartSpace Logo" className={className} />;
   };
   ```

3. **Replace `'../assets/logo.png'` with the path to your logo file as needed.**
4. **Save the file.** The application will now display the updated logo.
